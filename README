An extension to delete cookies from Firefox Mobile when the browser is closed

== Description ==

Unlike the Firefox for desktop, the native Firefox Mobile for Android devices
(aka Fennec) lacks a setting to delete all cookies when the browser is closed
(ie, turn all cookies in session cookies). Such option prevents sites and web
trackers from persisting data across browsing sessions, improving user privacy.

This extension aims to fix the problem until Firefox Mobile gets that feature
and, once enabled, will delete *ALL* cookies upon exit -- there is no white
list for allowed cookies yet.

THIS ADD-ON IS NOT INTENDED TO RUN IN FIREFOX FOR DESKTOP! After all, cookie
purging is a built-in feature for that version.



== Usage ==

The add-on have no user interface and will not clutter your device's screen
with any widget. To enable or disable the automatic deletion of cookies, just
go to Menu -> More -> Add-ons -> Delete Cookies on Exit -> Enable/Disable.



== New features and development ==

This add-on was born as a simple hack to solve a very specific problem and
no new features are planed for the short term. A possible enhancement is
to allow white-listing of cookies that will persist across sessions -- since
I do not use Firefox Mobile for extended website logins and I am not sure if
it worth the development effort, but any developer interested in such feature
is welcome to write it.

All development is done in GitHub. Just check out the repository
