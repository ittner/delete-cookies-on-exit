== Description ==

This add-on deletes all cookies when Firefox Mobile is closed, but stills
allows them to be used in the current browsing session (so it do not prevent
site logins which needs cookies).  This improves user privacy by preventing
websites and, more importantly, ad-providers and web trackers from persisting
any information (specially personally identifiable information) between two
browsing sessions.

THIS ADD-ON IS NOT INTENDED TO RUN IN FIREFOX FOR DESKTOP! Cookie purging is
a built-in feature in that version, so no extension is needed.


= Justification =

Unlike Firefox for desktop, the native Firefox Mobile for Android devices do
not have any advanced cookie management options, including a setting to delete
all cookies when the browser is closed (ie, turn all cookies in session
cookies), which improves user privacy by preventing sites and web trackers
from persisting data across browsing sessions.  This problem is exacerbated
by the lack of a setting to reject third-party cookies -- there is an option
to disable *all* cookies, but using it also prevents any benign cookie usage
(eg. login to sites). There is a feature request open to add these options in
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=764433 .

This extension allows the user to delete the cookies when the browser closes,
preventing websites and (more importantly) ad-providers and web trackers from
correlating two browsing sessions.




== Usage ==

The add-on have no user interface and will not clutter your device's screen
with any widget. To enable or disable the automatic deletion of cookies, just
go to Menu -> More -> Add-ons -> Delete Cookies on Exit -> Enable/Disable.



== New features and development ==

This add-on was born to solve a very specific problem and no new features are
planned for the short term. A possible enhancement is to allow white-listing
of cookie that may persist across sessions but, since I do not use Firefox
Mobile for extended website logins, I am not sure if it is worth the
development effort, but any developer interested in such feature is welcome
to write it.

All development is done in GitHub and comments and feedback are welcome. The
repository is available in https://github.com/ittner/delete-cookies-on-exit
